## **Overview**

*Drone Apocalypse* is a fast-paced first-person shooter where players battle waves of flying drones in a dark, dystopian city. The game features a dynamic combat system, intelligent drone AI, and timed gameplay mechanics where every kill extends the countdown timer. Developed entirely in Unreal Engine 5 using Blueprints, this project showcases my proficiency in AI programming, combat mechanics, and user interface design.

Engage in thrilling first-person combat with a variety of weapons against aggressive drones. The combat mechanics are designed to feel responsive, fluid, and intense.

Players must clear all drones within a set time limit. Each drone kill extends the timer, adding tension and excitement as the countdown clock ticks away.

- **Resource Management**   
Players can collect health and ammo pickups scattered across the environment, which are essential for surviving the drone onslaught.

- **User Interface (UI)**   
The HUD includes a countdown timer, health bar, and score indicator, providing real-time feedback to the player and enhancing gameplay immersion.

High-quality particle effects and sound design make every shot and explosion feel impactful, with dynamic audio that intensifies the action.
